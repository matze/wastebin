# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Format burn page like the rest.


## 2.3.1

**2023-02-04**

### Fixed

- Return correct exit code in case of errors.


## 2.3.0

**2023-02-01**

### Changed

- **Breaking**: replace deletion timer with a cookie based solution that
  identifies creator of a paste on subsequent visits. That cookie is a
  monotonically increasing number and only used to implement the delete
  functionality. Because that implies it is a strictly necessary cookie
  according to GDPR, we **will not show a cookie banner**. If you are
  uncomfortable with that either strip the `Set-Cookie` header from responses
  via a proxy server or stop using this software.
- **Breaking**: stop supporting down migrations.
- Compress data with zstd for a reduction of about 75%. On migration all rows
  will be compressed. However file size will not change but unused pages be used
  for new rows. If you want to reduce the file size, you have to use the
  `VACUUM` statement.
- The database is not purged periodically anymore, instead expired entries are
  removed on access.

## 2.0.0

**2022-07-31**

### Changed

- **Breaking**: remove possibility to GET `/api/entries/:id`, just use `/:id`.
- **Breaking**: remove possibility to POST to `/api/entries` and DELETE
  `/api/entries/:id`, this can be done on `/` and `/:id` respectively. Note that
  DELETEing `/:id` will now return a 303 status code instead of 200.
- Return appropriate content type for `/:id` based on `accept` header (i.e.
  `text/html` returns the HTML page) and the `fmt` query parameter (i.e. set to
  `raw` returns raw text).
- Use `dl` query parameter to determine the extension to download a paste.
- Use `fmt=raw` query parameter to fetch plain text paste.
- Set cache control timeout for the favicon.
